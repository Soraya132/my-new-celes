              As a Social Impact Company, with 99% of our team originating from
              Third World Countries, we are dedicated to addressing the
              significant under-representation of women in the tech sector. Our
              mission is to narrow this gender gap by gradually introducing
              young girls to the technology field from an early age,
              particularly here in Kenya.

                Introducing young girls to the technology industry: We plan to
                visit various primary and secondary schools across Kenya to
                inspire young girls and women about the tech industry. During
                these mentorship tours, we will distribute sanitary towels,
                stationery, refreshments, and Celestial Crafters printed
                T-shirts. Our goal is to create a lasting impact by driving
                positive change and narrowing the gender gap in tech, paving the
                way for future generations of female leaders.
